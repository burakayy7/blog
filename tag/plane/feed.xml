      <content type="html" xml:base="https://burakayy.com/blog/Plane-Project">&lt;p&gt;Welcome everyone!! In this post, I would like to introduce you guys to my long held dream: to build an autonomously flying high-altitude, long range, airplane! And to make things more
interesting, it has to be made from off-the-shelf components, with fully DIY code!! Enjoy!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, every since elementary school, I have always wanted to build and fly my own RC plane; and I have the notebook entries and failed foam planes to prove it!! However, I always was confronted with the same three challenges: cost, complexity, and technical knowledge. Buying all the components necessayr to build a plane from scratch is obviously going to cost a lot. Then, there’s the complex system or framework you have to make in how all the electronics and mechanics will work together in a compact and lightweight manner. And finally, to do all of this, you require knowledge in how each component works, like Arduinos, servos, radios, etc. And this was quite a lot until I got into this hobby in late 7th grade. That’s when I finally decided to go all in on this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After many failed attempts, there I was a couple months back, in winter break. Yet again, building another plane chasis from foam boards. Until I came accross this video by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aODpSGoqLY&quot;&gt;Joe Barnard&lt;/a&gt;. BOOM! It hit me. Why am I tyring to do everything from scratch??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I got myself one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/XFLY-MODEL-Wingspan-Airplane-Beginner-Transmitter/dp/B0BXD5R27D/ref=sr_1_15?crid=WZMKIZSUOAT4&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9OWWmkdCHsz5c-DNkaQEVo5dcEsyN6YgMk2Jh6pfwYn-7OCxUGz47DwV7FBpYgiSUy5ZZizDdL_rXp-tFn2dxgsmeqqXCv9zOYPHiXomlUAzDSGgnSF6U17HNJWNdMgpP4XzlZ-0RcZLCktkPGsGLAGi8avZwyn6T1VsiaOEdMRackGgAovn_xBZwFRZ9BZe-4-WMrchm7K31_wqc1zBKMxKihaUryryl2EgthBlgSu4BO3LXGnrp9W6ZXOqph2QF4GnLsTna1z0FyISWm3T9qumG_ynAnxrc-Sf04sLAWc.jEpOzOXoMyrPtl7LCrAT3I9b4OoVqs5ST567iDZtuDo&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=volantex+rc+glider&amp;amp;qid=1721079633&amp;amp;sprefix=volantex+rc+glider%2Caps%2C103&amp;amp;sr=8-15&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; but like a 2-meter one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This took some time to build, as it was quite complicated and I also had to figure outwhat I had to do to modify this into a usable craft for my goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the main specifications/details of this plane:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it has a 2-meter wingspan, meaning it has &lt;ins&gt;flaps and ailerons&lt;/ins&gt;. This large wing is supported by &lt;em&gt;carbon fiber&lt;/em&gt; strips/rods in the control services and the foam is suooprted with two &lt;em&gt;aluminum rods&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the main body is made from PVC plastic, and is supported by wooden platforms in the interior. All control services are from compressed foam (more durable and flexible).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the motor is in the front, and is quite a beast. To support this (and to prevent breaking on landing), the propeller is foldable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the plane has a single wheel under the chasis, to aid landing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the wings can be taken off, via clips. Thus, the wings, after fitted to the aluminum rods, “clip” onto the main fram via plastic clips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you cans see, this is quite a complicated project, and it will have plenty of complex mini-projects involved with it. And you probably are wondering how long will this project take me? &lt;ins&gt;I expect that I will be working on this my entire high school career.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to document as much I can, but since this will take a lot of time and focus, I believe I am bound to fall out of precedence for documenting this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, and I hope to see you back for updates!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://burakayy.com/blog/flight-computer">&lt;p&gt;To fly and eventually control my glider plane, I will need to build some sort of flight controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-requirements&quot;&gt;Design Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When designing this board, there are a few things to think about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Needs to be relatively low-cost and low-power&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have at least 6-8 PWM output channels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a decently powerful processor and memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, at first I tried to implement a 3.3 Volt Arduino, however I reached a few challeneges while trying to integrate a 3.3v microcontroller with a 5v system. So to make things easier for me at first, I decided to also mandate &lt;strong&gt;a 5v based microcontroller&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This limits us to basically one board: &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-every?srsltid=AfmBOorussHllcNNi7DAuhcRlTEKWFRgRz5NkDBpnv1aMg8-ZC8_AIm3&quot;&gt;Arduino Nano Every&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Nano Every board is somewhat of an Upgrade to the Original Nano board, but it still isn’t anywhere near the computing power we need for this project. This board is simply a “test environment” for this project, to make sure everything works the way we want it to before we move onto autonomous mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this board still has a lot of features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It runs at 20 MHz&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has 48 KB of CPU Flash Memory&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;onboard 6 KB of SRAM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;256 bytes of EEPROM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has UART, SPI, and I2C compatibility; MUST have multiple UART Channels!!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;all while being 5V compatible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s very cheap; so all in all, this is probably the prefect development board for testing the first few flights of this plane!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wiring&quot;&gt;Wiring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have drawn up a simple wiring diagram on my &lt;em&gt;Project Notebook&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;img src=&quot;assets\images\arduinoEng\flightcomputer2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a very well defined diagram, it is mainly for me to have a reference as to what goes where as I’m soldering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first version, there will be only two characteristics: read data packets from the radio receiver and send control signals to the control surfaces. That means we don’t need to add a IMU yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I have soldered everything by hand, here is the final result:
&lt;img src=&quot;assets\images\plane\plane-computer2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very simple, for now all we need is access to PWM channels to control the motor and control surfaces. Furthermore, we need an i2c input from the radio receiver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-case---update---july-9th-2022&quot;&gt;The Case - &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt; - July 9th, 2022&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets\images\plane\plane-computer3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to secure this board in the frame of the plane, I 3D designed a case in Autodesk Fusion 360. Around this time, I finally saved enough money to buy myself a 3D printer. I got it on discount so it was quite cheap, but still. I bought the Ender 3 V2 3D Printer from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets\images\plane\case3d.png&quot; alt=&quot;p&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, once I go into integration, I will show you my plans in how I want to put this into the frame of the plane. This was just a quick “background” info type of post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <link href="https://burakayy.com/blog/PlaneProject-Update" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Plane Project Update | Fixing UART Communication Problems on SAMD11" />
      <published>2023-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2023-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>https://burakayy.com/blog/PlaneProject-Update</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://burakayy.com/blog/PlaneProject-Update">&lt;p&gt;Ok, I have been very busy at school, and I was also spending a lot of time fixing the brocken pieces from the last crash, which took MONTHS!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I’m back, and let’s see what I have in plan….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW SOFTWARE!! I developed new code for this test flight, and that is what I will be testing out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as you probably read before, the aluminum rods got bent, and the wing compartment was broken. So, I had a fix for those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was also another problem. The battery had slid out of its hold and had slammed into the motor shaft, causing a “firey” combustion!! The battery literally started buffing up and excreting smoke!! It was bad, so, to prevent this from happening in the future, I have added a foam block in the front:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/plane/plane_foam_block.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;foam&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made a bunch of changes to the flight computer soldering job, because a few years ago when I originally completed it, I did a “not so good job”, so I fixed some parts, and its better now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a big software update, that is actually why I am testing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for reference, here was the old code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-cpp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#include &amp;lt;Wire.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;Servo.h&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#define MIN_PULSE_LENGTH 1000 // Minimum pulse length in µs
#define MAX_PULSE_LENGTH 2000 // Maximum pulse length in µs
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Servo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Servo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Servo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Servo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;esc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;escPin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;aileronPin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;elevatorPin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ch1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;uint16_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;chVal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ibus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;readChannel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;chVal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;startVal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stopVal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift in how we read data packets from the radio receiver changed due a problem I hit, which is defined this &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.arduino.cc/t/problem-using-ibusbm-with-nano-every/1061552&quot;&gt;this forum post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The error I hit was actually super hard to debug (for me at the time). When I tried to use the IBusBM library (which is the recommended library for this) I would get this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;no matching function for call to 'IBusBM::begin(UartClass&amp;amp;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s back up a bit here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radio receiver I have can output the data it receives via the UART protocol (which is basically Serial communication). Every Arduino has Serial, as you program it with USB. But I want a way to program and read at the same time, because if I only have 1 UART Bus, then I can only read from one channel at a time, which means I cannot have USB and the receiver at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the Arduino Nano Every has multiple UART pins!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I tried to use them with Serial1. And it gave the above error!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone on the forum said this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;I haven't worked through the details, but the code compiles with MegaCoreX 2 set for the Nano Every.

I think the answer to the issue lies somewhere in the difference between the two cores (MegaCoreX, megaavr) and how Serial1 is defined.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I then tried to fix. But it didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the SAMD11 Chip thats on board has certain timers that are needed for the Serial communication. So the special line that ended up fixing it was this, which says that there will be “no timer”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-cpp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ibus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;begin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Serial1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IBUSBM_NOTIMER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, once I have made all the mechanical fixes, and the frimware updates, I am ready for &lt;strong&gt;Test Flight #3!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <updated>2024-10-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>https://burakayy.com/blog/opto-motor-driver</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://burakayy.com/blog/opto-motor-driver">&lt;p&gt;So, as you know, I have been dealing with foam hobby planes for a long time. And I have finally decided to build a mini club flier to help me train for flying my 2-meter glider. But to build those, I would always need some way to power/control the motor, and always the 3.3v devices failed to power them. I lacked cheap motor drivers or an esc for these small motors, so usually I ended up quitting projects that involved flight (unless I saved enough money to buy escs and powerful motors, which only happened once). But this ends today, because today I will show you a super simple motor driver I made!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so how this will work is that I will use a Photocoupler (Optocoupler) to control a much higher voltage circuit (which is the circuit running the motor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-an-optocoupler&quot;&gt;What is an Optocoupler&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, in short terms, it is a device that uses light to transfer a signal from one circuit to another, all while being voltage independent from the other circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one end of the sensor, there is a built-in LED, which is turned on with a signal. Then this light will turn on a “transistor-like” electronic switch that is activated via light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/plane/opto1.png&quot; alt=&quot;opto1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As, you can see, with the image above and below, this is a device that allows you to control two electrical systems, completely independent of voltage levels!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/plane/opto2.png&quot; alt=&quot;opto2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really usefull to me, as I am not in the situation right now to spend more money on electronic components (like an ESC, or MOSFETs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now for the actual build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, first I prototyped the devices on my breadboard using a Raspberry Pi Pico (because this was the computer I planned on using):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets\images\plane\opto_breadboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;i&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you would like to see an explanation of this, here is a video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/X07X5WzkbOw?si=VnT9Xf9SqKM-HXk6&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, anyways, here is a diagram of the circuit:
&lt;img src=&quot;assets\images\plane\opto_circuit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;i&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This circuit has been the result of much researching, experimentation, and a bit of luck. But finally, I arrived at the above circuit I designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, be careful (as this was something I did when I transferred this over to the actual device, which caused me a lot of pain after words), please do’t put a very low resistance on the transistor capacitor (R2). Because if you put, say a 100 ohms, then the circuit will not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How it works, it after the optocpuler is activated, it allows negative ground to flow to the base of the NPN transistor, which shuts off the gate , turning the motor off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, is the code I used to PWM the speed of the motor (I used Thonny with MicroPython to program the Pi Pico):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;machine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;machine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PWM&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;utime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;motor1A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;machine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Pin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;machine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Pin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OUT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;motor2A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;machine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Pin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;machine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Pin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OUT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pwm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PWM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;motor1A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duty_step&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Step size for changing the duty cycle
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#Set PWM frequency
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;frequency&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pwm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;frequency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;clockwise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;motor1A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;high&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;motor2A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;low&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;anticlockwise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;motor1A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;low&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;motor2A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;high&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;stopMotor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;motor1A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;low&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;motor2A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;low&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duty_cycle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;65536&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duty_step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pwm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duty_u16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duty_cycle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Decrease the duty cycle gradually
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duty_cycle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;65536&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duty_step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pwm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duty_u16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duty_cycle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code works by creating a PWM object, on a certain pin (which is the one the optocouler will be attached to). We then set the duty_step to 129 and the frequency to 5000. This will basically determine the type of digital wave we will be creating. How fast will this occur in a given amount of time? How fast will we change the ratio? And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with those, we loop through the various duty_cycles (which will determine the ratio of 1 to 0), incrementing by duty_step; we then feed this into the output pin using this function, which should achieve a PWM signal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pwm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duty_u16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duty_cycle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are some images to me soldering on this device:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets\images\plane\soldering1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;i&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets\images\plane\soldering2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;i&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see below, there are 3 pairs of pins, the 1 that is by itself, is the input one (where the Pi Pico will attach itself). Then, on the top-right to the image, is the motor output, where the two leads of the motor will attach. And on the top-left, that is the motor power’s input (it can be any voltage the transistor and motor can take!). Cool right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets\images\plane\soldering3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;i&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this tiny controller, we can PWM control really powerful motors, with like 12 volts, all by controlling a 3.3v pin on the Pi Pico!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to use this extensively in future projects, and I hope this was helpful to you in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, and I will see you next time!!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Now, be careful (as this was something I did when I transferred this over to the actual device, which caused me a lot of pain after words), please do’t put a very low resistance on the transistor capacitor (R2). Because if you put, say a 100 ohms, then the circuit will not work. How it works, it after the optocpuler is activated, it allows negative ground to flow to the base of the NPN transistor, which shuts off the gate , turning the motor off. Below, is the code I used to PWM the speed of the motor (I used Thonny with MicroPython to program the Pi Pico): import machine from machine import PWM import utime from time import sleep motor1A = machine.Pin(14, machine.Pin.OUT) motor2A = machine.Pin(15, machine.Pin.OUT) pwm = PWM(motor1A) duty_step = 129 # Step size for changing the duty cycle #Set PWM frequency frequency = 5000 pwm.freq (frequency) def clockwise(): motor1A.high() motor2A.low() def anticlockwise(): motor1A.low() motor2A.high() def stopMotor(): motor1A.low() motor2A.low() while True: for duty_cycle in range(0, 65536, duty_step): pwm.duty_u16(duty_cycle) sleep(0.05) # Decrease the duty cycle gradually for duty_cycle in range(65536, 0, -duty_step): pwm.duty_u16(duty_cycle) sleep(0.05) This code works by creating a PWM object, on a certain pin (which is the one the optocouler will be attached to). We then set the duty_step to 129 and the frequency to 5000. This will basically determine the type of digital wave we will be creating. How fast will this occur in a given amount of time? How fast will we change the ratio? And so on. And with those, we loop through the various duty_cycles (which will determine the ratio of 1 to 0), incrementing by duty_step; we then feed this into the output pin using this function, which should achieve a PWM signal: pwm.duty_u16(duty_cycle) And here are some images to me soldering on this device: As you can see below, there are 3 pairs of pins, the 1 that is by itself, is the input one (where the Pi Pico will attach itself). Then, on the top-right to the image, is the motor output, where the two leads of the motor will attach. And on the top-left, that is the motor power’s input (it can be any voltage the transistor and motor can take!). Cool right? With this tiny controller, we can PWM control really powerful motors, with like 12 volts, all by controlling a 3.3v pin on the Pi Pico!!! I plan to use this extensively in future projects, and I hope this was helpful to you in some way. Thanks, and I will see you next time!!</summary>
