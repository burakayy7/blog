Welcome everyone!! In this post, I would like to introduce you guys to my long held dream: to build an autonomously flying high-altitude, long range, airplane! And to make things more
interesting, it has to be made from off-the-shelf components, with fully DIY code!! Enjoy!!


So, every since elementary school, I have always wanted to build and fly my own RC plane; and I have the notebook entries and failed foam planes to prove it!! However, I always was confronted with the same three challenges: cost, complexity, and technical knowledge. Buying all the components necessayr to build a plane from scratch is obviously going to cost a lot. Then, there's the complex system or framework you have to make in how all the electronics and mechanics will work together in a compact and lightweight manner. And finally, to do all of this, you require knowledge in how each component works, like Arduinos, servos, radios, etc. And this was quite a lot until I got into this hobby in late 7th grade. That's when I finally decided to go all in on this!

After many failed attempts, there I was a couple months back, in winter break. Yet again, building another plane chasis from foam boards. Until I came accross this video by [Joe Barnard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aODpSGoqLY). BOOM! It hit me. Why am I tyring to do everything from scratch??

So, I got myself one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/XFLY-MODEL-Wingspan-Airplane-Beginner-Transmitter/dp/B0BXD5R27D/ref=sr_1_15?crid=WZMKIZSUOAT4&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9OWWmkdCHsz5c-DNkaQEVo5dcEsyN6YgMk2Jh6pfwYn-7OCxUGz47DwV7FBpYgiSUy5ZZizDdL_rXp-tFn2dxgsmeqqXCv9zOYPHiXomlUAzDSGgnSF6U17HNJWNdMgpP4XzlZ-0RcZLCktkPGsGLAGi8avZwyn6T1VsiaOEdMRackGgAovn_xBZwFRZ9BZe-4-WMrchm7K31_wqc1zBKMxKihaUryryl2EgthBlgSu4BO3LXGnrp9W6ZXOqph2QF4GnLsTna1z0FyISWm3T9qumG_ynAnxrc-Sf04sLAWc.jEpOzOXoMyrPtl7LCrAT3I9b4OoVqs5ST567iDZtuDo&dib_tag=se&keywords=volantex+rc+glider&qid=1721079633&sprefix=volantex+rc+glider%2Caps%2C103&sr=8-15) but like a 2-meter one.


This took some time to build, as it was quite complicated and I also had to figure outwhat I had to do to modify this into a usable craft for my goals. 

Here are the main specifications/details of this plane:

- it has a 2-meter wingspan, meaning it has <ins>flaps and ailerons</ins>. This large wing is supported by _carbon fiber_ strips/rods in the control services and the foam is suooprted with two _aluminum rods_!
- the main body is made from PVC plastic, and is supported by wooden platforms in the interior. All control services are from compressed foam (more durable and flexible). 
- the motor is in the front, and is quite a beast. To support this (and to prevent breaking on landing), the propeller is foldable.
- the plane has a single wheel under the chasis, to aid landing
- the wings can be taken off, via clips. Thus, the wings, after fitted to the aluminum rods, "clip" onto the main fram via plastic clips.


As you cans see, this is quite a complicated project, and it will have plenty of complex mini-projects involved with it. And you probably are wondering how long will this project take me? <ins>I expect that I will be working on this my entire high school career.</ins>

I will try to document as much I can, but since this will take a lot of time and focus, I believe I am bound to fall out of precedence for documenting this.

Thanks, and I hope to see you back for updates!
