Hi, my name is Burak Ayyorgun and I wanted to share how I started with Engineering and give advice how you guys might want to start. The main goal is to find what you are interested in & how to chase your own projects. 

# Who am I, and how I got Started
First, I wanted to give a quick introduction and how I started engineering. Currently, I'm a high school student and I first started my engineering projects in 7th grade for as cheaply as possible. I had acquired an interest in electricity and how electronics components work. So, I started to teach myself these concepts using free resources on the internet; I would dismantle toy trains, cars, or even radios for there electronic parts. 

Driven to learn how they worked, I kept a journal to document my progress. I taught myself the physics behind why motors work, or why electrons flow and why batteries work. It all seemed very attractive to me. Once I learned the fundamentals, I got myself electronics kits, which contained components like transistors, capacitors, resistors, LEDs, and many more. After I went through a few tutorials on YouTube, I experimented my making my own circuits. I tried to make transistor calculators, timer circuits, and so much more exciting things. Around this time, I got myself an Arduino kit (from my holiday money) and I slowly started to learn embedded programming. At first, I thought it was kind of cheating in engineering, because you could accomplish a hard task in electronics like blinking an LED, with a couple lines of code I felt that I wasn't being compelled to learn HOW things worked. However, once I eventually moved onto more complicated projects (mostly robotics related ones) I realized the power of Arduino. Having a single board, capable of accomplishing almost anything just via code, is an incredibly valuable tool. 

The reason I am explaining this is to show that you **don't need an expensive budget to start engineering, nor do you need to take an engineering class.** <ins>All you need is a passionate interest in learning, be motivated to try new challenging topics, patiently dedicated, and a good source that is tailored for self-learners, hence this course!</ins>

# Getting Started with Arduino

So, you have an interest in engineering and programming and you want to start an Arduino project. The first thing you will need is some knowledge of electronics.

### Electronics

A strong knowledge of Arduino prototyping requires a pretty good understanding of breadboard prototyping. I learned this with trial and error, but you can use plenty of free online resources. Furthermore, you will need an understanding of basic electronic components, like transistors, capacitors, resistors, LEDs, and general ciruit grounding.
