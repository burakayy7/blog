I wanted to share how I started with Engineering and give advice how you guys might want to start. The main goal is to find what you are interested in
& how to chase your own projects. 


I started with actual technical projects as a side hobby in middle school. I had gained an interest in electronics in 7th grade and I had started to take
toys apart for their electronic parts. I would dismantle toy trains, cars, or even radios. I wanted to learn how they worked and I also 
kept a journal to document my progress. I tried to teach myself the physics behind the principles that allowed electromechanics to work;
the why behind motors work, or why electronics flow and why batteries work. It all seemed very attractive to me.

Once I learned the fundamentals, I got myself electronics kits, which contained components like transistors, capacitors, resistors, 
LEDs, and many more. After I went through a few tutorials on YouTube, I experiemented my making my own ciruits. I tried to make transistor
calculators, timer circuits, and so much more exciting things. 

Then, in the summer of 7th grade, I got myself an Arduino kit for a holiday. This was the first time I was introduced to embedded programming
and programming in general. At first, I thought it was kind of cheating in engineering, because you could accomplish a hard task in electronics
like blinking an LED, with a couple lines of code. I felt that I wasn't being compelled to learn HOW things worked. However, once
I eventually moved onto more complicated projects (mostly robotics related ones) I realized the power of Arduino. Having a single board, capable
of accomplishing almost anything just via code, is an incredibly valuable tool.
