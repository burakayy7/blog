Here, we will learn what ARIMA models are, how they work, and how they can be useful; we will implement an Autoregressive Model from SCRATCH! 


If we want to go and design a model like this, the first thing we need to know is how is it going to learn? And if you have taken the Linear Regression lesson, then you should remember **Cost Functions**. 

### Cost Functions

There are many different cost functions out there, and each one can either help or hinder different models. In this lesson, we will show three main and common cost functions
_Mean Squared Error_(MSE), _Mean Absolute Error_(MAE), and _Root Mean Squared Error_(RMSE).
