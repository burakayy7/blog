Here, we will learn what ARIMA models are, how they work, and how they can be useful; we will implement an Autoregressive Model from SCRATCH! 

As in the previous lessons, you probably learned what Autocorrelation is and how it works. Well, the idea of autocorrelation can come in usefull when
we are talking about predicting a certain function. Please also make sure that you have read the Gradient Descent lesson and/or 
have a solid understanding of Linear Regression.

## Autoregression
We can take the fundamental theory of autocorrelation and combine it with the ideas of Regression & Gradient Descent and arrive at something called Autoregression.
In simple words, autoregression is like linear regression, but it runs the regression algorithm on sections of data, at once, unlike a linear regression,
which runs a regression in a pair of values.
