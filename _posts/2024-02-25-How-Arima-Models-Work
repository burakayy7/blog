Here, we will learn what ARIMA models are, how they work, and how they can be useful; we will implement an Autoregressive Model from SCRATCH! 

As in the previous lessons, you probably learned what Autocorrelation is and how it works. Well, the idea of autocorrelation can come in useful when we are talking about predicting a certain function. Please also make sure that you have read the Gradient Descent lesson and/or 
have a solid understanding of Linear Regression.

So what, if any, does ARIMA stand for? 

ARIMA stands for an **A**uto**R**egressive, **I**ntegrated, **M**oving **A**verage. But what do each of these terms mean?

## Autoregression
We can take the fundamental theory of autocorrelation and combine it with the ideas of Regression & Gradient Descent and arrive at something called Autoregression. 
In simple words, autoregression is like linear regression, but it runs the regression algorithm on sections of data, at once, unlike a linear regression, which runs a regression in a pair of values.

In equation terms:
$$
    y_t = \phi_1 \cdot y_{t-1} + \phi_2 \cdot y_{t-2} + ... + \phi_p \cdot y_{t-p} \tag{1}
$$

This basically means that the current y value will equal some relationship between the past p-lagged values. But what do I mean when I say *lagged*? Well, all I mean by that is the past p values, where p can be any number greater than zero, but less than (or equal to) n (the length of the data). Can you see why we call it *lags*?

What equation 1 represents, is something called an AR(p) model, or an autoregressive model of order p. Simply put, this is basically a multiple regression model. 

If we want to go and design a model like this, the first thing we need to know is how is it going to learn? And if you have taken the Linear Regression lesson, then you should remember **Cost Functions**. 

### Cost Functions

There are many different cost functions out there, and each one can either help or hinder different models.
