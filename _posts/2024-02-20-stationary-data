To prepare for the next lesson, I wanted to provide a quick lesson explaining what stationary data is.

## What is Stationarity

By textbook definition, a stationary time series (a dataset which is a function of time) is one that contains properties which are **not** dependent on
when the dataset is observed. In other words,  a stationary time series is a dataset that only contains periodic, or repeating, (cyclic) properties that won't affect the value at t. For example, 
time series which contain trends or have 'seasons' are not stationary because these properties will be affected depending on when you observe the graph. Contrary, a time series which
is stationary would be white noise because it should look about the same, independent of when you observe the graph. To summarize, stationary time series
will have no predictable patterns over time and it should have constant variance. 

### Differencing

One quick and easy way to convert a stationary time series to a non stationary one is by taking the difference between consecutive values; this is known
as **differencing**.

```python
def difference_data(data):
  new_data = data.copy()
  for i in range(1, len(data)):
    new_data.iloc[i] = data.iloc[i]-data.iloc[i-1]
  return new_data
```
