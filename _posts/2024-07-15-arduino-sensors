One of the main applications of an Ardunio board is by utilizing various sensors, actuators, and other devices


## Photosensors

Or sometimes called, photoresistors, these are electronic components that will change their electrical resistance based off how many photons hit its sensitive surface. I have talked about this sensor in [my report in this previous lesson](https://burakayy.com/blog/arduino-electronics#my-technical-report-on-photoresistors), and I hope you go back to that and review!

## Touch Sensors

There are multiple different modules you can buy for a touch sensor, but these are a waste of money as a simple wire can be a touch sensor. I have detailed how to build a touch sensor in [this](https://burakayy.com/blog/Touch-Delay) lesson.

# Temperature and Humidity

Let's say you are gardening plants in a greenhouse and you need an automated way to collect the temperature and humidity, how will you accomplish this? Well, you can use [this](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/grove-temperature-humidity-sensor-pro?srsltid=AfmBOoqYoffAkhPifA9yp4xX23G8pze6Jj0sfVQu1lXpHfzy7GpCsR8A) module. There should be a temperature sensor in the [Elegoo Kit](https://burakayy.com/blog/How-to-start-Arduino#getting-started-with-arduino), which you can follow along with. 

# PIR Motion Sensors

This is a motion sensor that utilizes changes in IR (Infared Red) Light. It basically has hemispheres with sensors in it, and when there is a gradient from one to another, it will send a pin high (from a 0 to a 1). We will need to read this using Arduino Analog Pins.



# Ultrasound Sensors

Ok, this sensor is actually quite interesting. To introduce it, 

# IR Reciever

# Inertial Measurement Units (IMU)
