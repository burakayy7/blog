One of the main applications of an Ardunio board is by utilizing various sensors, actuators, and other devices


## Photosensors

Or sometimes called, photoresistors, these are electronic components that will change their electrical resistance based off how many photons hit its sensitive surface. I have talked about this sensor in [my report in this previous lesson](https://burakayy.com/blog/arduino-electronics#my-technical-report-on-photoresistors), and I hope you go back to that and review!

## Touch Sensors

There are multiple different modules you can buy for a touch sensor, but these are a waste of money as a simple wire can be a touch sensor. I have detailed how to build a touch sensor in [this](https://burakayy.com/blog/Touch-Delay) lesson.

# Temperature and Humidity

Let's say you are gardening plants in a greenhouse and you need an automated way to collect the temperature and humidity, how will you accomplish this? Well, you can use [this](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/grove-temperature-humidity-sensor-pro?srsltid=AfmBOoqYoffAkhPifA9yp4xX23G8pze6Jj0sfVQu1lXpHfzy7GpCsR8A) module. There should be a temperature sensor in the [Elegoo Kit](https://burakayy.com/blog/How-to-start-Arduino#getting-started-with-arduino), which you can follow along with. 

# PIR Motion Sensors

This is a motion sensor that utilizes changes in IR (Infared Red) Light. It basically has hemispheres with sensors in it, and when there is a gradient from one to another, it will send a pin high (from a 0 to a 1). We will need to read this using Arduino Analog Pins.



# Ultrasound Sensors

Ok, this sensor is actually quite interesting. To introduce it, this sensor is basically a proximity sensor that uses sound waves. You can think of it like a radar, it sends out a sound wave, and listens for the time between when it will return, and since we know the speed of sound we can use math to calculate the distance an object is from us. 

# IR Reciever

While this can also be used for a proximity sensor, in this case, we won't be doing that. The IR sensor simply recieves IR (Infared Red) light. 

# Inertial Measurement Units (IMU)

In my opinion, one of the most important sensors for your robotics projects, the IMU is basically an orientation sensor. It will measure your acceleration and gyroscopic rotation. How it works is really fancy, so I will try to simplify it.
