One of the main applications of an Ardunio board is by utilizing various sensors, actuators, and other devices


## Photosensors

Or sometimes called, photoresistors, these are electronic components that will change their electrical resistance based off how many photons hit its sensitive surface. I have talked about this sensor in [my report in this previous lesson](https://burakayy.com/blog/photoresistors#my-technical-report-on-photoresistors), and I hope you go back to that and review!

## Touch Sensors

## Temperatur and Humidity

## PIR Motion Sensors

## Ultrasound Sensors

## IR Reciever

## Inertial Measurement Units (IMU)
