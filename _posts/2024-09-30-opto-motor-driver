So, as you know, I have been dealing with foam hobby planes for a long time. And I have finally decided to build a mini club flier to help me train for flying my 2-meter glider. But to build those, I would always need some way to power/control the motor, and always the 3.3v devies failed to power them. I lacked cheap motor drivers or an esc for these small motors, so usually I ended up quitting projects that invovled flight (unless I saved enough money to buy escs and powerful motors, which only happened once). But this ends today, because today I will show you a super simple motor driver I made!

Ok, so how this will work is that I will use a Photocoupler (Optocoupler) to control a much higher voltage circuit (which is the circuit running the motor).

## What is an Optocoupler

Well, in short terms, it is a device that uses light to transfer a signal from one circuit to another, all while being voltage independent from the other circuit.

In one end of the sensor, there is a built-in LED, which is turned on with a signal. Then this light will turn on a "transistor-like" electronic switch that is actiavted via light.

As, you can see, with the image above and below, this is a device that allows you to control two electrical systems, completely independent of voltage levels!!

This is really usefull to me, as I am not in the situation right now to spend more money on electronic compnents (like an ESC, or MOSFETs).
