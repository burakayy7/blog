This is probably the most important part of this project: software. This is actually the whole point in what I am trying to achieve with this!

The idea is that I will be able to plug in a GPS coordinate anywhere in a certain range, and the plane will automatically navigate to that spot. Cool right? Well, this is SUPER DUPER complicated, especially with the aspect of testing this in a safe manner. Like, even if I do code this, how can I make sure it works??
