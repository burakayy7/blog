Now, if we want to be a good engineer in this day and age, we need to also know Computer Science. Arduino especially relies on this as this is how we will program the Board.

Ok, so you probably have learned that Arduino is a development platform where you program a microcontroller. In the Arduino Environment, you do this with the [Arduino API](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/programming/reference/) (I am assuming you have downloaded the Arduino IDE in the previous lessons).

Let's dive in!!


# Variables

So, let's say you had a bunch of data or information you wanted to store in a computer program, how would you do that? The simple way is to declare a _variable_ and the compiler (converting code to machine language) will the Arduino how to store a piece of information. 

That's simply what a variable is, a way to store information. 

Let's see a few examples of the different types of info you can store:
    - Characters: 
    - Integers
    - Floats
    - Doubles
    - Strings

# Functions

# Arduino Sketches
