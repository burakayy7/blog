Welcome back; here I will introduce you to the fundamentals and basics of Electronics for Engineering.

To follow along, please refer to the introductory lesson to find the link to an Arduino Kit, which will contain plenty of electronic components and a breadboard.


## How Does a BreadBoard Work

A breadboard's purpose is to help with efficiency when prototyping a circuit; instead of having to [solder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solder) every component, without knowing the circuit will work, wouldn't it be nice to have a "plug-n-play" set up where you can easily interchange components?

Well, the breadboard comes to the rescue!

Below is a diagram of how the various pins on your board are connected:

Usually, breadboards have two sets of horizontal strips that run accross the long side, each usually labelled with a red or blue strip. These are generally used for 
power, providing current to your ciruit; however, these are not directly connected to the pins on the inside. I will explain how this works further, with examples.

So, refering to both of the diagrams above, each pin along a column is connected. But pins across rows are not connected. Furthermore, pins that cross the barrier
in the middle are also not connected. 

This setup provides a framework which you can easily and systematically desin your own ciruits.


## How Do Resistors Work

Resistor are an electronic component that, as the name implies, restricts and resists the flow of electrons in a circuit.

But how does this work? 

Well, each [conductive material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor) has its own properties, which results in each material conducting electricity
slightly differently. Thus, each material will also resist electricity differently. For example, copper is a very conductive material, which means 
it has a low resistance. 

Below is a diagram showing the guts of a resistor:

As you can see, there is some internal conductive material that is a mixture of various material with different properties.
This will result in the final material to have a different resistance than the pins (connecting leads). 

The coloring on the resistor also has a meaning. It is some sort of code for the resistance. However, these are often not
standarized or hard to read and remeber, so I usually don't pay attention to them.


## How Does a Transistor Work

If you search this up, probably the first "definition" you will come accross is " a transistor is an electronic switch".
However, I have never liked this definition, as I think not only is it basic but it's lacking.

Below is a schematic diagram of a transistor:

As you can see, there are three main pins (or leads): the collector, the base, and the emmittor. Now, I could go into what each pin is,
but to understand a transistor, we have to go down to the atomic level and understand what's **in** a transistor first, then
we can understand what the pins mean.

To understand this, I think it is best if we tackle what a Diode is and how it works.

### How Does a Diode Work

A diode is an electronic component that basically restricts the flow of electrons, but only in one direction.


Below is a diagram of what the inside of a diode might look like, at an atomic level:

To start, let me explain what you are looking at. Basically, there are two materials inside of a diode: a n-type material and a p-type material.
But what does this mean? 

Well first, these materials are made up of mostly silicon. 



## How Does an LED Work

Simply put, this is stands for a **L**ight **E**mmitting **D**iode, and it does exactly as it sounds like: emmites light by
utilizing physical properties of certain materials.
