In the previous lessons, we have learned topics from Autocorrelation, Moving Average, and Differencing, to 
ARIMA Models and Multiple Regression. And we have applied these methods to various datasets, to better understand
how to apply this in the real world. However, there is a whole other world in the field of forecasting epidemic diseases
outside of ARIMA. So, to summarize and finish this course, I would like to talk about the importance of forecasting, what
to look forward to in the future, and next steps to learn more. 

## How utilize forecasting principles in the real world and How is this relevant

I am sure you all remember the COVID-19 pandemic, and the possible catastrophic effects it had. This is a poor example as it was a new disease
and we didn't have much data on it at the time, so we will get back to that. 

But let's consider an outbreak of the FLU, we already have plenty of data on that, including hospitilizations (when and specifically which locations got impacted),
and multiple other statistically measurable metrics have been recorded. What if there was a way for scientists and doctors
to be able to not only predict the next FLU outbreak, but also in which location that will occur, over time? 

This would be of tremendous interest to governments as it would give them a 'heads up' or advance to disease outbreaks,
giving them extra time to prepare a response.

This was actually one of the reasons the COVID-19 Pandemic had such wide spread effects, because we weren't ready to battle such a disease. The nations
around the world weren't prepared for it, which resulted in both a panicked state by the public, and late decisions by government
officials, something that if made earlier, could of saved millions.
