In the previous lessons, we have learned topics from Autocorrelation, Moving Average, and Differencing, to 
ARIMA Models and Multiple Regression. And we have applied these methods to various datasets, to better understand
how to apply this in the real world. However, there is a whole other world in the field of forecasting epidemic diseases
outside of ARIMA. So, to summarize and finish this course, I would like to talk about the importance of forecasting, what
to look forward to in the future, and next steps to learn more. 

## How utilize forecasting principles in the real world and How is this relevant

I am sure you all remember the COVID-19 pandemic, and the possible catastrophic effects it had. This is a poor example as it was a new disease
and we didn't have much data on it at the time, so we will get back to that. 

But let's consider an outbreak of the FLU, we already have plenty of data on that, including hospitilizations (when and specifically which locations got impacted),
and multiple other statistically measurable metrics have been recorded. What if there was a way for scientists and doctors
to be able to not only predict the next FLU outbreak, but also in which location that will occur, over time? 

This would be of tremendous interest to governments as it would give them a 'heads up' or advance to disease outbreaks,
giving them extra time to prepare a response.

This was actually one of the reasons the COVID-19 Pandemic had such wide spread effects, because we weren't ready to battle such a disease. The nations
around the world weren't prepared for it, which resulted in both a panicked state by the public, and late decisions by government
officials, something that if made earlier, could of saved millions.


## Next Steps to Research on Your Own

I have found my interests shift towards these types of mathematical related programming quite a bit over the time I have researched this topic,
and I highly suggest that you too start to individually observe this topic too! As you probably have seen in this course, there is quite a bit of math topics
we dicuss here, some I go in-depth on, others I leave to the reader. And out of all the things about Computer Science, the thing I enjoy
the most is applying math I have learned and understood to solve real world problems. And I suggest you invest in your own interests
and projects to apply theories to solve real world problems and have an affect on the world.

### SIR Models

### Datasets

I made this course because when I wanted to learn more about this field, either there was a limited amount of resources, or they didn't explain everything in advance, which would help me understand.
I hope that this course was easy to follow and has taught you something interesting, hopefully encouraging you to learn further.
