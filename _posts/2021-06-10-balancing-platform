To apply the control theory I learned from the Internet, let's make a self-balancing platform that implements
a PID Controller. 

Below are the materials I used:
- a breadboard
- Arduino Nano
- BNO055 IMU
- 2 sets of high torque servos

The inspiration for this project is from Paul McWhorter's lesson on [PID Controllers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlJ_F4jDKLo&list=PLGs0VKk2DiYwEo-k0mjIkWXlkrJWAU4L9&index=24).
You can follow his lessons on building the servo rig, as it can get complicated and it best learned through video.
