Imagine a plane traveling at 60 MPH perpendicular to the ground. What do you think would happen. 

This is what happened to me when I went to go test out my glider software. I had hit full throttle when it was traveling
straight down, in an attempt to recover. When impact came, the entire plane just folded. 

The crazy thing is that this plane has two thick aluminum rods in the wing chases, and the impact exerted such a strong
force that it bent the rods. Furthermore, the internal battery slide off the mount and the front motor
punctured the battery (I don't have pictures of this, as it was a fire hazard and I had to dispose of it quickly).

### The Problem

The main inertia is in the wings, so in a sudden stop, they will be the parts that pose the most issues.

This plane's wings work by 'clicking' into the chasis, as below:

### My Fix #1: Epoxy

Since I thought that this piece of plastic was the best bet I had, I decided to keep it and instead glue the two broken pieces together, using epoxy.

While at first it looked good, on the next test flight, it broke again.

# **UPDATE** - 5/25/2023

I had another test flight, and it broke, again!

So now, I am moving towards 3D printed parts.
