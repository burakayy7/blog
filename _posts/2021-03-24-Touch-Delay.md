*I posted this 2 years after the actual date, so I kind of forgot exactly when!
Enjoy!

This project is a very simple idea where after you touch a sensor and LED slowy turns on or off, hence the delay. The delay is caused from the 
charging or discharging of a capacitor. 
This circuit here is the delay but with a button instead of a touch sensor: ![](assets/images/td1.jpg)
And this cicuit is the actual touch part, where a simply wire acts as the 'touch sensor': ![](assets/images/td2.jpg)

At the end I wrote that it need to be the wall power, however this isn't actually true. 

I ended up using a slightly modified version of this in one of my future projects.
