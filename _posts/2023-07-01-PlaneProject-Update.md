Ok, I have been very busy at school, and I was also spending a lot of time fixing the brocken pieces from the last crash, which took MONTHS!!!

But now I'm back, and let's see what I have in plan....

NEW SOFTWARE!! I developed new code for this test flight, and that is what I will be testing out!

So, as you probably read before, the aluminium rods got bent, and the wing compartment was broken. So, I had a fix for those. 

But there was also another problem. The battery had slid out of its hold and had slammed into the motor shaft, causing a "firey" combustion!! The battery literally started buffing up and extreting smoke!! It was bad, so, to prevent this from happening in the future, I have added a foam block in the front:

I also made a bunch of changes to the flight computer soldering job, because a few years ago when I orinonally completed it, I did a "not so good job", so I fixed some parts, and its better now. 

I also have a big software update, that is actually why I am testing this.
