After wanting to do experiment with AI on my Raspberry Pi 4, I decided to build a Servo actuated Pan-tilt mount from scratch. For the past few days, I have been working hard 3d modeling a mount that not only works but also looks good.

I have a whole seperate github repository for it [here](https://github.com/burakayy7/Servo-PanTilt-PiCam).
