Recently, I had to write a short paper in my Advanced Chemistry class related to a chemistry topic I am interested in. And since I have a huge interest in electronics, I thought why not write this short report on Photoresistors! And I thought I should share it below for other people to view it. 

While I will not go through the report in this post (reach out if you would like me to do that), I will just provide the PDF:

I hope you enjoyed that, I will see you next time!
