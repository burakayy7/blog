Hello, I wanted to share with you a small project I did. It involves a wearable, Arduino Powered, Nerf Gun!!

See, after watching Iron Man, I really wanted to build my own "arm gun". And I had a old automatic nerf gun lying around, so I got an idea: repurpose the old nerf gun parts, fuse them with Arduino, and design a way to wear it.

## How does an Automatic Nerf Gun Work

If you have every gotten the chance to take a nerf gun apart, you will see two DC motors (at least the ones that are battery powered).
